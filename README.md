#### 2. Define Entities:

2.1. **User Entity:**
- Create a User entity with fields like `user_id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `fullname`, `is_active`.

2.2. **Role Entity:**
- Define a Role entity with fields `id` and `name`.

2.3. **Account Entity:**
- Create an Account entity with fields `account_id`, `user_id`, `account_number`, `balance`, `account_type_id`, `currency`, `is_active`.

2.4. **AccountType Entity:**
- Define an AccountType entity with fields `id` and `description`.

2.5. **Card Entity:**
- Create a Card entity with fields `id`, `card_name`, `pan`, `expire_month`, `expire_year`, `cvc_number`, `user_id`, `account_id`, `is_active`.

2.6. **Transaction Entity:**
- Define a Transaction entity with fields `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `amount`, `transaction_type_id`, `transaction_date`.

2.7. **TransactionType Entity:**
- Create a TransactionType entity with fields `id`, `name`, and `category`.

2.8. **TransactionDetails Entity:**
- Define a TransactionDetails entity with fields `id`, `transactions_id`, `service_id`, `organization_service_code`.

2.9. **Service Entity:**
- Create a Service entity with fields `id`, `organization_name`, `service_name`, and `merchant_code`.

2.10. **Cashback Entity:**
- Define a Cashback entity with fields `transaction_id`, `refund_amount`, `account_id`.

#### 3. Implement Functionality:

3.1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
- Create REST endpoints for user registration, login, and password reset.

3.2. **User and Admin Operations:**
- Implement functionality for admin operations like adding, deactivating users and getting user information.

3.3. **Account Operations:**
- Implement operations related to user accounts, such as adding accounts, viewing active cards, and getting transactions.

3.4. **Financial Transactions:**
- Implement functionality for deposit, payment, and cashback based on transaction criteria.

3.5. **Microservices Architecture:**
- Divide the application into microservices, considering the separation of concerns and scalability.

#### 4. Email Notification:

4.1. **Integrate Email Service:**
- Integrate an email service for sending notifications, including password reset emails and transaction summaries.

#### 5. Video Presentation:

5.1. **Record Video:**
- Create a video presentation demonstrating the developed functionalities.

5.2. **Include Documentation:**
- Provide narration or on-screen text explaining each functionality.

#### 6. Testing:

6.1. **Unit Testing:**
- Write unit tests for critical components using JUnit and Mockito.

6.2. **Integration Testing:**
- Perform integration testing to ensure the different modules work well together.

#### 7. Documentation:

7.1. **Code Documentation:**
- Add comments and documentation to the code for better understanding.

7.2. **User Guide:**
- Prepare a user guide explaining how to use the online banking platform.

#### 8. Deployment:

8.1. **Deploy to Cloud:**
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.

8.2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

# Next steps
Testing:
Unit and Integration Testing:
Write thorough unit tests for all your entities, services, and utility classes using JUnit and Mockito.
Conduct integration tests to test the interaction between various components and microservices.
6. Front-end Development:
   If not already in progress, begin the development of the front-end application that will interact with your backend, using a framework that suits your preference (e.g., Angular, React).
7. Documentation and User Guides:
   In-Code Documentation:
   Ensure that your code is well commented and understandable.
   API Documentation:
   Use tools like Swagger or Spring Rest Docs to create comprehensive API documentation.
   User Guide:
   Start drafting a user guide or help documentation for end-users of the platform.
8. Continuous Integration and Deployment:
   CI/CD Pipeline:
   Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
   Automate your testing and deployment processes to streamline your workflow.
9. Security Enhancements:
   Review and Reinforce:
   Conduct a security audit of your application, ensuring all endpoints are secure, data is encrypted, and proper authentication and authorization are in place.
   Implement rate limiting, SQL injection prevention, and other security best practices.
10. Performance Optimization:
    Database and Queries:
    Optimize your database interactions and queries for better performance.
    Application Optimization:
    Profile your application and optimize bottlenecks.
    Review and Iterate:
    Regularly review your progress against the roadmap.
    Adapt your plans based on testing feedback, new requirements, or challenges faced during development.
    Keep stakeholders updated with progress and any changes to the timeline or scope.
